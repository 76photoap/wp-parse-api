# Wordpress Parse Api

Bridge between parse.com api and wordpress

## Description

The goal of this plugin its to replicate all your posts to parse.com so you can easily
develop mobile apps, because I find very useful their SDK and help us to develop
apps faster without worring about the security or if someone else can read data from our blog
and use it.

## Frequently Asked Questions
